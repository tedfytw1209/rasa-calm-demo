Both diseases are characterized by recurrent attacks of optic neuritis and myelitis. Studies on SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for patients with CNS demyelinating diseases suggest that vaccines are safe and that they do not increase the risk of relapse (Lotan et al., 2021, Lotan et al., 2021, Achiron et al., 2021, Ciampi et al., 2022, Alonso et al., 2021, Ali Sahraian et al., 2021). However, the role played by vaccination could be double-edged. Vaccine antigen may provoke an exaggerated autoimmune reaction (Chen et al., 2001, Kivity et al., 2009) and trigger clinical relapses in patients with NMOSD (Apostolos-Pereira et al., 2021) and MS (Michelena et al., 2022). Recently, several cases of acute demyelinating disease of the CNS (optic nerve, brain, and/or spinal cord) following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been reported (Pagenkopf & Südmeyer, 2021, Khayat-Khoei et al., 2021, Kaulen et al., 2021, Ismail & Salama, 2021, Chen et al., 2021, Netravathi et al., 2022, Badrawi et al., 2021, Abboud et al., 2020, Fragoso et al., 2022).

The patients with MS recruited between 2016 and 2018 fulfilled the McDonald 2010 criteria (Polman et al., 2011).

The A(H3N2) strain is more likely to mutate, thus evading vaccine-induced immunity and resulting in lower VE. In addition, A(H3N2) is more sensitive to genetic substitutions that occur during the production of egg-based influenza vaccines. Thus, new influenza vaccines are being developed and manufactured to avoid these mutations, in an effort to improve influenza VE. One newer vaccine formulation, recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), is not produced in egg culture, thereby lowering the possibility for mutations; it contains three times the amount of antigen as standard dose (SD) vaccines and has been shown to be effective against influenza in a RCT in healthy adults,Citation2 and to be more effective than SD to prevent influenza cases in a RCT in adults aged 50 years and over.Citation3 Therefore, RIV4 may be more effective for those with reduced immune function such as the elderly, and people with high-risk conditions, than other vaccine formulations.Citation3 VE studies of specific vaccine types and relative VE studies among various vaccine types are generally limited until uptake of specific vaccines reaches sufficient numbers for comparative analyses. This constraint has been especially evident among younger adults whose overall influenza vaccine uptake is generally lower than that of older populations.Citation4 While there are numerous studies of the rVE of cell-cultured influenza vaccine,Citation5–7 there are relatively few involving RIV4 VE against outpatient influenza illness, and that include non-elderly adults. We conducted a retrospective test-negative case-control study of influenza VE against medically attended outpatient illness using data from electronic medical records (EMR) of a large health system to determine the VE of influenza vaccines and relative VE (rVE) of RIV4 among persons 18–64 years of age in the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 seasons.",Both the EMR and Pennsylvania Statewide Immunization Information System (PA-SIIS) were queried for influenza vaccines given between August 1 and the date of illness/PCR testing.

Therefore, we first identified all MHS members who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result by 2 December 2020 (2 March 2021 minus 90 days) and had not been previously vaccinated, therefore meeting the eligibility exposure criteria for a vaccine (that is, hypothetically eligible to be randomly assigned and meeting the washout period criteria).

The cohort includes adult patients who have reported a SARS-CoV-2 infection (whether or not confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result or serological assay, or both) and have symptoms persisting for more than three weeks after the original infection.

In the time-to-event analysis, the study baseline was defined as the vaccination date for patients in the vaccinated group, and the vaccination date of their matched patient for those in the control group; the treatment effect was thus directly related to the efficacy of vaccination at 120 days after vaccination. For the analysis of the two patient scores (symptom and impact tools), however, baseline was defined as the patient's state 120 days before the outcome measurement and up to 60 days before vaccination; the treatment effect was thus related to the efficacy of vaccination from 60 to 120 days after vaccination. To account for variation in outcome measurement times, we assessed how time since vaccination affected the study outcome and found no evidence of an interaction between the delay from baseline to the time of vaccination and the severity of patients' symptoms or the effect on their lives (online supplemental material 10).
Fourthly, because the outcome was self-reported and the intervention was not blinded, the difference in outcomes between the two groups might be a result of specific and placebo (non-specific) effects.
